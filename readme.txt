== Description ==

Prevents annoying popups and surveys when you deactivate WordPress plugins. No settings, simply activate the plugin.

As an extra bonus, the plugin will append a "Disabled Deactivation Script" in red next to any plugins on the plugin list to let you know it disabled some JavaScript event on the deactivation link (likely a popup or survey).



== Installation ==

1. Download the zip file from Github using the "clone or download" button.
2. Log into your WordPress site and go to Plugins
3. Click the "Add New" button at the top
4. Click the "Upload Plugin" button at the top.
5. Click the "Choose File" button and choose the file from your computer.
6. Activate the plugin once installed



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's a plugin survey? =

When you deactivate some WordPress plugins, you get a popup before the plugin is deactivated asking you why you are deactivating the plugin. This is a survey for use by the plugin author or company. Usually you'll only find this in plugin companies selling paid plugins, but they are slowly becoming more common.

= Why would you want to disable them? =

If you are a developer this is especially annoying if you are deactiving a plugin on a testing site often (for example).
