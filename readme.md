# Plugin Survey Stopper

Prevents annoying popups and surveys when you deactivate WordPress plugins. No settings, simply activate the plugin.

As an extra bonus, the plugin will append a "Disabled Deactivation Script" in red next to any plugins on the plugin list to let you know it disabled some JavaScript event on the deactivation link (likely a popup or survey).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's a plugin survey?

When you deactivate some WordPress plugins, you get a popup before the plugin is deactivated asking you why you are deactivating the plugin. This is a survey for use by the plugin author or company. Usually you'll only find this in plugin companies selling paid plugins, but they are slowly becoming more common.

### Why would you want to disable them?

If you are a developer this is especially annoying if you are deactiving a plugin on a testing site often (for example).
